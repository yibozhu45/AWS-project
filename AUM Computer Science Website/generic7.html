							<h2><font color = "orange">Upcoming and Past Department Colloquia and Events Schedule</font></h2>
						</header>
						<p>An annual outreach program to encourage young women to explore mathematics-related careers. The event offers mathematics activities for young women via hands-on workshops and a career panel for question & answer. Sponsored by the department and other AUM offices. The Sonia Kovalevsky Mathematics High School Day is an annual program of mathematics activities for young women. Sponsored by the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) and Auburn Montgomery's Department of Mathematics and Computer Sciences, it is named in honor of Sonia Kovalevsky, who was the first woman to earn a doctorate in mathematics in 1874. The event is designed to encourage high school-aged women to consider careers in mathematics and the sciences. Sonia Kovalevsky Days have been organized by AWM and institutions around the country since 1985. It is generally held at AUM during the latter half of February or early March.</p>
						<p>High school teachers from throughout Alabama are invited to bring their female students to Montgomery to meet the AUM mathematics faculty, professional women who use math in their careers, and other high school students who are interested in math. Event workshops focus on inspiring participants to continue their study of mathematics and lead to careers in mathematics and sciences. <br>
						All participants receive books and prizes. A pizza lunch is provided. </p>
						<p>Auburn University at Montgomery is committed to providing accommodations and services to individuals with disabilities. Event attendees who have questions or need special accommodations to participate in Sonia Kovalevsky Day should contact Jerome Goddard at 334-244-3023 or
						<a href = mailto : "jgoddard@aum.edu"><font color = "blue">jgoddard@aum.edu</font></a> on or before the preregistration deadline. TDD users may call 334-244-3754.</p>

							<h2>Computer Arts and Animation Summer Course</h2>
						</header>
						<p>AUM has developed a major interactive computer arts training system that applies Computational Thinking (CT) with geometrical methods in visual art skill development for young learners. The short course is a great start for students interested in animation and development. In a fun environment, students can:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Learn the fundamentals of animation</li>
							<li>Discover the basics of Video Game Development</li>
							<li>Uncover the digital world of Computer Arts</li>
							<li>Enjoy the latest technology</li>
						</ul>
