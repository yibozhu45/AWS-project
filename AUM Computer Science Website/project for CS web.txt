Instruction：

Phase I:
Project 2: Decide what tool to use and what steps to involve. Optional: Complete initial steps.
Project 3: Decide what tool to use and draw a system architecture(component)/data flow diagram.

Create a web app that is hosted by one or more service(s) from:
	Elastic Beanstalk
	AWS Amplify
	Amazon Lightsail
	AWS Lambda
Redesign our CSCI department website:
	http://sciences.aum.edu/departments/math-and-computer-science
Besides the existing 9 pages (they can be static pages), you need to add one extra page for GA/TA application. Requirements:
	It should be a dynamic page  (python, php, jsp, node.js etc.)
	It contains a html form to submit applicant’s information:
		name, student number, e-mail address
		resume (it should be uploaded through html input “file upload” elements)
	Auto scale up: e.g. hard drive space, network etc.

Example: (php) https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_file_upload.asp
Example: (Node) https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_uploadfiles.asp
You can test it locally before deploy it to the cloud.
