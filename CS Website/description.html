            <h1>Program Description</h1>
            <p>Do you want to know how to design and program the computers powering some of today’s greatest innovations? Ever wondered how your phone knows where the nearest Starbucks is, how Google’s self-driving car is even possible, or how your music and photos live in the cloud? Maybe you want to know how computers protect businesses — and people — and other cybersecurity issues. AUM’s Computer Science Program, with a curriculum based on the latest ACM/IEEE recommendations and an emphasis on high-performance computing, will prepare you for a career in computer programming, networking, database management, multimedia design or technology architecture.</p>
